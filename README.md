# infinity-market
Full stack market place JavaScript app for the buying and selling of products between users. 

This repo is dedicated to a full stack app for characters from the Marvel Cinematic Universe to buy and sell relics from the MCU. 
Two classes for defining user and product objects and routers for different endpoints - the different controls users can do to interact with the market place. Buy products, view available products,
sell products, etc.

NOTE: If you want to try this code and run it, you will need to install node_modules through your terminal. I did not include them in this repo for the sake of the file size/quantity.
